# Github Playground

Welcome to the Github Playground.  This is a place to test out how to work within a Git project.

## Goal

To achieve this task, we will be completing a simple task: creating a simple travel guide to the cities in which we a) live; and b) grew up.  Each of these cities' travel guides will exist as a single markdown named after the city, located within a directory named for the state in which the city is located.

Example:

    playground/
      idaho/
        boise.md

## Tasks

Each of you should be given a basic task assigned to you as an `Issue`, dictating a specific job that you must fulfill.
